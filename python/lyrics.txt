[Verse]
When raindrops fell down from the sky
The day you left me, an angel cried
Oh, she cried
An angel cried, she cried

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Ariana Grande]
There is somethin' between us, I can see it right now
Your magnetic demeanor, that’s something can't be found
I thought that I was dreamin' ’til my love came around
Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I can't believe that you are here, I can't believe it's happening
What are the odds that you'd appear?
The universe so vast to me
Seven billion is on the Earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play Lotto? What's it worth?
I must be on, so clear to me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Ariana Grande]
There is somethin’ between us, I can see it right now
Your magnetic demeanor, that’s something can't be found
I thought that I was dreamin’ 'til my love came around
Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Look at you, love, you are the same
You have a light you cannot hide
Yes, you may have a different face
But your soul is the same inside
I don't care who is listening
'Cause they be making fun of this on TV
They wouldn’t laugh if they were inside my past life
With you and they were me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go, oh
Never let you, never let you go, yeah
Never let you

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams & Ariana Grande]
Don't think that it cannot happen, 'cause it can
Shawty, you can get blazed
Sleep if you want, and wake up in love again
Shawty, you can get blazed

[Outro: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
(Shawty, you can get blazed)
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you

Ah, gonna break that shit down
You don't wait, tell 'em wait another round
Ah, guess you're way above it now
And that's your way to love it now

How can they tell you shit that you've been through?
They are so confused, who cares about their rationale?
If it ain't your view
That's the bottom line
Know-it-all (Know-it-all)
Give you a box of chances, every time you blow it all (Blow it all)

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was sleep ('Sleep)
You're such a dream to me, mmm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe (If you can believe)
You're such a dream to me

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like:
"I love you—who starts a conversation like that?"
Nobody but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
(No I don't want, no)
'Cause you're such a dream (Does this end?)
If you can believe, you're such a dream to me
To me, mmm, boy, to me

[Chorus]
You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
Ain't nobody else can relate
Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
Baby, lay me down and let's pray
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah) And I can be all the things you told me not to be
(Yeah) When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
(Yeah) And he see the universe when I'm the company
It's all in me

[Chorus]
You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done
You'll believe God is a woman
And I, I feel it after midnight
A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

[Verse 2]
(Yeah)
I tell you all the things you should know
So baby, take my hands, save your soul
We can make it last, take it slow, hmm
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it, yeah
But you're different from the rest
And boy, if you confess, you might get blessed
See if you deserve what comes next
I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
When life deals us cards
Make everything taste like it is salt
Then you come through like the sweetener you are
To bring the bitter taste to a halt

[Post-Chorus]
And then you get it, get it, get it, get it (Ayy)
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it (Ayy)
Flip it, flip it, flip it

Your mama sent us horoscopes (Us horoscopes, sheesh)
Had so much fun watching them unfold (Sheesh, yeah)
You said she like me, I smiled, I know (Ayy)
So when they ask, "How’s life?" I go (Sheesh, sheesh)

[Bridge]
And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night
Things that we can light make me say oh, oh (Sheesh, sheesh)
Talking 'bout what you wanna do, whether it's wrong or right
I am followin’ you 'cause you make me say oh, oh (Sheesh, sheesh)
Said I don't know what I'd do without you in my life, it'd be so sour
I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours

[Chorus]
When life deals us cards
Make everything taste like it is salt (Sheesh, sheesh)

You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Think 'bout you all of my days
Wish you'd chew on me like fresh grapes
Not tryna cuff you or crowd your space
I'm tryna find cute words just to say
"Dang, you fine, and look at that face"
At the borderline, beside me, you lay

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Baby, I just want you to be mine
Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, whoa
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline

[Verse 1]
You keep me in your orbit
Well, I know I'm a hard one to please
Give it too much importance
My love'll have you fall to your knees
I tell 'em this too often
Know better than to bark up my tree
Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

[Verse 2]
Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition
I dismiss 'em all, no offense, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

[Outro]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

[Verse]
Tell me why you gotta look at me that way
You know what it does to me
So baby, what you tryna say? Ayy
Lately, all I want is you on top of me
You know where your hands should be
So baby, won't you come show me? Mmm
I got you, I got you dreamin' (Ahh)
You close your eyes and you're screamin' (Ahh)
Play with your mind for no reason
I know you love how I tease it (Ahh-ah)
You know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
You already know what I'm thinkin', boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well

[Chorus]
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go

[Bridge]
One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
(It's always say goodnight and go)
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
(At my convenience)
We'd be good, we'd be great together

[Pre-Chorus]
Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well

[Chorus]
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Post-Chorus]
I know how you want it, baby, just like this
Know you're thinkin' 'bout it, baby, just one kiss
While you're lookin' at 'em, baby, read my lips
I know what you want, but you can't have this

[Outro]
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Wanna say goodnight
Honey, say goodnight and go
Wanna say goodnight
Baby, say goodnight and go
Wanna say goodnight
Say goodnight and go

[Intro]
Mmm, yeah, yuh

[Verse]
I thought you into my life (Whoa), look at my mind (Yuh)
No better place or a time, (Look) how they align
Universe must have my back, fell from the sky into my lap
And I know you know that you're my soulmate and all that
I’m like ooh, ooh, my whole life got me ready for you, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Got me happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy, yeah

[Intro]
You can feel it, feel it
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
They say my system is overloaded
(Girl, what’s wrong with you? Come back down)
I'm too much in my head, did you notice?
(Girl, what’s wrong with you? Come back down)
My body's here on Earth, but I'm floating
(Girl, what’s wrong with you? Come back down)
Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone

[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body, yuh yuh
Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we talking about it
Yeah, we talking about it
To deal with it, don't try to get by it
Ain't no time to deny it
So we had to sit down and just write it

[Verse 2]
Want you to get better (Woo!)
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
(Girl, what’s wrong with you? Come back down)
Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mmm?
(Girl, what’s wrong with you? Come back down)
Down, down, down, down
Is there such a ladder to get above this?
(Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
(Girl, what’s wrong with you? Come back down)
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is
Before I'm gone

[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body, yuh yuh
Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we talking about it
Yeah, we talking about it
To deal with it, don't try to get by it
Ain't no time to deny it
So we had to sit down and just write it

[Bridge]
You can work your way to the top
(You can feel it, feel it, woo)
Just know that there’s up and downs and there's drops
(You can feel it, feel it, woo)
Unfollow fear and just say "You are blocked"
(You can feel it, feel it, yuh)
Just know there is so much room at the top
(You can feel it, feel it, yuh)

[Refrain]
Well here's one thing you can trust, yuh
It take you and me to make us (Yeah)
One of those days you had enough (Yeah), I'll be there, yuh yuh yuh
'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another
When you need someone to pull you out the bubble (Out the bubble)
I'll be right there just to hug you (Just to hug you), I'll be there
Where are you? Are you home? Call me right on the phone
I'll be there (Ayy, sheesh), yeah, I'll be there
I don't care who is gone (I don't care who is gone), you shouldn't be alone (You shouldn't be alone)
I'll be there (Mmm), there

[Bridge]
You can work your way to the top (Woo!)
(You can feel it, feel it, woo)
(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me
I'm with you, I'm with you)
Just know that there’s up and downs and there's drops
(You can feel it, feel it babe)
(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me
I'm with you, I'm with you)
Unfollow fear and just say "you are blocked"
(You can feel it, feel it, yuh)
(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me
I'm with you, I'm with you)
Just know there is so much room at the top
(You can feel it, feel it, yeh)
(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me
No matter the issue)
No matter what, ah, ah, ah

[Refrain]
Here's one thing you can trust, yuh
It take you and me to make us (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
One of those days you had enough (Yeah, yeah, yeah), I'll be there, I'll be there (I'll be there)
'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another
If you need someone to pull you out the bubble
I'll be right there just to hug you, I'll be there
Where are you? Are you home? Call me right on the phone
I'll be there, yeah, I'll be there, I'll be there
I don't care who is gone, you shouldn't be alone
I'll be there, ooh, there

[Outro]
You can work your way to the top
(You can feel it, feel it)

[Verse 1]
Step up, the two of us, nobody knows us
Get in the car like, "Skrrt"
Staying up all night, order me pad thai
Then we gon' sleep 'til noon
Me with no makeup, you in the bathtub
Bubbles and bubbly, ooh
This is a pleasure, feel like we never act this regular

[Pre-Chorus]
Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes

[Chorus]
Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world

[Verse 2]
Knew you were perfect after the first kiss
Took a deep breath like, "Ooh"
Feels like forever, baby, I never thought that it would be you
Tell me your secrets, all of the creep shit
That's how I know it's true
Baby, direct it, name in the credits
Like the movies do

[Pre-Chorus]
Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes

[Chorus]
Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world

[Outro]
Can you imagine it?
Can you imagine it?
Can you imagine it?
Can you imagine it?
Can you imagine it? (Can you imagine?)
Can you imagine it? (Can you imagine?)
Can you imagine it? (Can you imagine?)
Ooh, imagine it (Can you imagine?)
Imagine it, imagine it
Imagine it, imagine it
Imagine, imagine
Imagine, imagine
Imagine, imagine

[Verse 1]
If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (Yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (Selfish)
But after all this damage, I can’t help it (Help it)
But what you can trust is I need your touch

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I’m a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

[Chorus]
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

[Intro: Shangela Laquifa Wadley]
This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

[Bridge]
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
(Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under)

[Outro]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight

[Intro: Marjorie Grande]
Because I'm trying to do the best I can
And they can't find something to satisfy me, ugh

I know what you need, but it won't be me

I know what you looking for, but I'm complete
I know what you need, but it won't be me (But it won't be me)

After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears

[Verse 1]
Another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I’m sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I’m not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin’ on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it’s shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I like to fuck with you just to make up with you
'Cause the way you be screamin’ my name
Make me wanna make love to you
I might break up with you just to make up with you
At the end of the day, boy
You know that I'm 'bout to wake up with you

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go ’head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

[Verse 2]
My energy and attitude don't really coincide
I'm stayin' mad all day so we can let it out tonight
Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops, surprise, surprise

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

[Verse 3]
Promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick
That’s the way to shut me up after an argument
No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life, just like that Fenty Beauty kit
Boy, you know what it is

[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go ’head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

Let me stay in my bag ’cause I like when you mad
It's a mood, it's a vibe, it's a look, it’s a match
Attitude, dream of mine (Dream of mine)
When you say that I'm right (That I'm right)
And I find that it works every time

[Chorus]
And I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
(And I love it when we make up)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh no, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Mmm, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
I know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time (This time)
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell (From hell)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you

[Chorus]
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

[Post-Chorus]
We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Though I wish he were here instead
Don't want that living in your head
He just comes to visit me
When I'm dreaming every now and then (And then)
And after all that we been through (And after all that we been through)
There's so much to look forward to
What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you (With you)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you, baby

[Chorus]
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
'Stead of ghostin' him

[Post-Chorus]
We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with (Girl with)
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you (Love you), we'll get past this (Past this)
I'm a girl with a whole lot of baggage, yeah yeah

[Intro: Doug Middlebrook]
Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel (Abel), Abel (Abel), Abel
I know you're able, willin’ and able

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought that you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin’ from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Yeah, yeah)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

[Outro]
Thought you were somebody else, you (You)
Thought you were somebody else, you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)

[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'—

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Said thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin'—

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)

[Post-Chorus]

Thank you, next
Yeah, yee

[Verse 1]
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Verse 2]
This shit always happen to me (Yeah)
Why can't we just play for keeps? (Mmm-mmm)
Practically on my knees (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you realize she's right there (Yeah)
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (In the mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (I don't care, yee)
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Post-Chorus]
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend

[Bridge]
You could say I'm hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right (Ain't right)
You could call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (Ain't nice, yeah)

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Hit in the mornin', yeah, yeah, yeah)

With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend

[Verse 1]
The sun is setting and you're right here by my side
And the movie's playing, but we won't be watching tonight
Every look (every look), every touch (every touch)
Makes me wanna give you my heart
I be crushin' on you, baby
Stay right where you are 'cause

[Chorus]
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
In the moonlight, moonlight

[Verse 2]
I kiss his fingertips as I'm wishing he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis with some James Dean in his eyes
Puts his lips (puts his lips) on my neck (on my neck)
Makes me want to give him my body
I be fallin' for you, baby, and I just can't stop, 'cause

[Chorus]
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
In the moonlight, moonlight
(Baby, I be fallin')
You are my moonlight, moonlight

[Outro]
He's so bossy, he makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip and just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy, but he's such a man
He knows just what it does when he’s holding me tight
And he calls me "moonlight" too

[Verse 1]
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

[Verse 2]
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you

[Post-Chorus]
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you

[Post-Chorus]
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that

[Outro]

But daylight is so close
So don't you worry 'bout a thing

[Chorus]
We're gonna be alright

And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough, 'til we cross the line, hey yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby

Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh

So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it

You know that I'm greedy for love
You know that I'm greedy for love
'Cause I'm so greedy, ooh
You know that I'm greedy for love

'Cause I'm so greedy, ooh
You know that I'm greedy for love
You know that I'm greedy for love
'Cause I'm so

[Refrain: Macy Gray]
Dangerous love
You’re no good for me, darling
Yeah, you turn me away
Like I’m begging for a dollar
Danger, oh, how you hold me
I get a chill inside
And nothing frightens me, baby, oh

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Is it love when so easily you said goodbye?
Is it love when we’ve given up before we tried?
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry and cry?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So when you walk out that door
Don’t you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

[Chorus 1: Ariana Grande]
You’re a dangerous love
Maybe you’re no good for me, darling
Cause if you’re gonna love me and leave me hanging here
Then I’d rather you leave me lonely
Even though it hurts
Ooh, you’re a dangerous love, oh

[Refrain: Macy Gray]
Dangerous love
You’re no good for me, darling
Yeah, you turn me away
Like I’m begging for a dollar

So when you walk out that door
Don’t you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

[Chorus 2: Ariana Grande]
You’re a dangerous love
Maybe you’re no good for me, darling
Cause if you’re gonna love me and leave me hanging here
Then I’d rather you leave, leave me lonely
Even though it hurts
You’re a dangerous love, baby

[Refrain: Macy Gray]
Dangerous love
You’re no good for me, darling

[Verse 3: Future]
I put that work on you everyday
When the night fall 'til the sun come up
You done fell in love with a bad guy
I don't compromise my passion
You know what you do for me, I'm doing the same for you
I don't be trippin' or makin' mistakes
I made too many in my past (that's right)
I fight for the things you believe in
I got your body and put it in drive, baby
Like I got keys in
We 'bout to take us a vacation
I'm 'bout to put all this vintage lovin' on you
Baby, like it was the late 80s
When you ride on me, baby, rotate it

[Verse 1]
I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you

[Chorus]
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 2]
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It used to be easy
For someone to steal me
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you, boy

[Chorus]
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes, babe

[Bridge]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here

[Chorus]
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Not even sometimes
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
(no, boy)
Not even sometimes

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Not even sometimes
Not even sometimes
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1]
Used to cry 'bout some crazy shit before
I used to feel so obligated to be so much more
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be
But if I can't be me, the fuck's the point?
No…

[Chorus]
I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore

[Verse 2]
Now I laugh about the things that used to be important to me
Used to have a hold on me, used to have a hold on me
Like what do you think, and what he thinks, and what they think
But I love me

[Chorus]
I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore

[Outro]
Yeah
I-I-I…
I-I-I don't care about it anymore
I-I-I don't care about it anymore

[Verse 1]
Boy, you know that you drive me crazy
But it's one of the things I like
Cause I know when you need it, baby
That I got that, ooh ooh
Let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talkin'
But it don't matter what they say
Cause you know when you hear me knockin'
Gonna get that, ooh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been doing stupid things
Wilder than I've ever been
You've become my favorite sin
So let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking
That's right

[Chorus]
We got that hood love
We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that "I don't give a what" love
We got that one life
Gimme that all night
We got that Bonnie and Clyde love
They say it's wrong, but that's the way you turn me on
We got that hood love
We got that good love
Make me make bad
Boy, you make me make bad decisions
Bad, boy, you make me make bad decisions

[Verse 2]
No, they ain't gonna understand it
Understand what I see in you
They don't know when you touch my body
That I see the truth
Let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking
Cause I know that I got someone
Anytime that I need some danger
Gonna get that, ooh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been doing stupid things
Wilder than I've ever been
You've become my favorite sin
So let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking
That's right

[Chorus]
We got that hood love
We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that "I don't give a what" love
We got that one life

[Bridge]
Don't you know I ain't fuckin' with them good boys?

If you want it, boy, you got it
Ain’t you ever seen a princess be a bad bitch?

[Chorus]
We got that hood love
We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that "I don't give a what" love
We got that one life
Gimme that all night

[Verse 1]
How do I make the phone ring?
Why do I even care?
How are you all around me, when you're not really there? (Mmm)
When you're not really there? (Ah, yeah, mmm)
How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin?
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in?
Oh yeah, baby, just come on in
Ooh yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

[Verse 2]
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? (Oh, ayy)
Baby, let's just forget (Ooh)
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's fall in love
Ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

[Refrain]
Ooh, ain't nobody gonna, touch it, touch it, touch it
Baby, ain't nobody gonna, touch it, touch it, touch it
Baby, ain't nobody gonna, touch it, touch it, touch it
Ooh, ain't nobody gonna touch it (Ooh)

[Bridge]
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's be in love

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone (Ooh)
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way (Ooh)
No, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Ain't nobody gonna)
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave (Behave)
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way (The way, ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Ooh)

[Outro]
Baby, ain't nobody gonna
Baby, ain't nobody gonna
Baby, ain't nobody gonna

[Verse 1]
Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I see right through you, boy
And I ain't feeling you no more
(I ain't feelin' you no more, I ain't feelin' you no more)

[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
'Cause ain't nobody like me (ain't nobody like me)
Ain't nobody like me (ain't nobody like me)
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby

[Interlude/Transition]

[Verse 1]
Never been with a boy more than six months
I couldn't do it, got too used to it
Ain't nobody ever kept my attention
They couldn't do it, yeah boy, they blew it

[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure

[Chorus]
Oh, be forever mine, you and I
Oh, be forever mine, boy, all the time
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy

[Verse 2]
Been friends for a minute
So you know just what I like
You know my mind
Even seen boys come and go
So you know what makes me cry
See, you're the one that treat me right

[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure

Oh, be forever mine, you and I
Oh, be forever mine, boy, all the time
Oh, mine, time
Oh, mine, time
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy

[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin' bout you
Yeah, I've been missing you
Where the hell are you
Oh, when I need you?
I could still hear your voice
I ain't got no choice
'Cause I'm here all alone
I know I can't wait 'til you get home

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

[Chorus]
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Got these thoughts in my head
Ain't no way to forget
Got me losing my breath
Nobody got me the way that you did
Had my eyes rolling back
Had me arching my back
Now you love me so good
I wish you would hurry up and come back

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

[Chorus]
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you, baby
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (I'm thinkin' 'bout you)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Say you don't, baby, 'bout you)

[Bridge]
Baby, I don't want no one, no one else
So hurry, 'cause I need some, need some, need some help
And I've been waiting patient, patiently
'Cause I don't have you here with, here with, here with me
But at least I have the memory

[Chorus]
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (I do)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you

[Verse]
I'll give you all I have
And nothing less, I promise
Love me and don't look back
I want you with me on this road to the sky
We'll be shining every night, I promise you
Just me and you
Oh, I promise you

Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one, like what

[Verse 1]
I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Verse 2]
I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful

'Cause I don't wanna be without you

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home (Takes you home, babe)
One more time

All I really care is you wake up in my arms

If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

[Chorus]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Verse 2]
You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

[Chorus]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Bridge]
No more, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams, it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Ooh, baby

[Chorus]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is (This is) the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah

[Outro: Ariana Grande & Big Sean]
You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
You, you, you, you
(Best mistake you ever had)
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Intro]
Yeah, baby
Ooh, babe

[Chorus]
If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my
Be my baby
Be my, be my
Be my baby, and drive me crazy

[Verse 1]
If you know how to treat me
You know how to touch me
Baby, then you'll get the chance, the chance to love me
It's obvious, I want to be into you
But it all depends on all the things you do
'Cause babe, I promise, I promise
If you keep it real with me, be honest, be honest
You can get anything you want, that you want, babe
Just show me everything I need to see
I'll give you anything, boy

[Chorus]
If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my
Be my baby
Be my, be my
Be my baby, and drive me-

[Verse 2]
I'll give you all of my trust if you don't mess this up
You ain't tryna get no other girls when you in the club
All you got is eyes for me
I'm the only girl you see
So if you treat me right just the way that I want you
Oh, baby boy, I promise that I'll be on you
Oh-oh, on you
Night to the morning

[Chorus]
If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my
Be my baby
Be my, be my
Be my baby, and drive me crazy

[Bridge]
I'll give you all of my trust, if you don't mess this up
You ain't tryna get no other girls when you in the club
All you got is eyes for me
I'm the only one you see

[Chorus]
If you know how to be my lover (Be my)
Maybe you can be my baby (By my side)
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy (Crazy, baby, yeah)
Be my, be my, be my, be my
Be my baby
Be my, be my
Be my baby, and drive me crazy

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I shoulda saw it coming
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby, you were so good, so good
You had me going blind
You said he was your best friend
I’m guessing I wasn't your type, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
You said I was your best, would be your last
Now he’s gone, you’re alone
Don’t want you back
You’re telling me you’re sorry
Well sorry, I'm over it
'Cause I've already been there done that
Not doing this again, no

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back

My baby loves me
My baby loves me

My baby loves me

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Listen, you got a man, but your man ain't loyal
Don’t understand how to spell it out for ya
Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask why
Sorry, had to tell you I'm a nice guy
Naw, I'm a sick guy, money too much
I step on stage, and girls move too much
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch
And he with them other guys, and you know it's true 'cause
Okay, G-A-M-B-I-N-O
I know they hate, but I don’t know why, uh
I know the way he did you was whack
But I know how you can get dude right back and get with me

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Childish Gambino]
Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tell everybody
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tell everybody
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tell everybody
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tell everybody
I'm coming out, he’s coming
I'm coming out

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I’ll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (lo-love me harder)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain
And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time

[Chorus: Ariana Grande, The Weeknd]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (I'ma love you harder, hey!)
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (baby I love you) (lo-love me harder)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder (oh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder (you gotta love me harder)

[Bridge: The Weeknd, Ariana Grande]
So what do I do if I can’t figure it out?
You got to try, try, try again, yeah (oh whoa)
So what do I do if I can’t figure it out?
I’m gonna leave, leave, leave again

[Chorus: Ariana Grande, The Weeknd, both]
'Cause if you want to keep me (hey!)
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (I'ma love you, love you, love)
And if you really need me (ooh)
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (got to love me, baby)
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (love me harder, love me harder)
And if you really need me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love me, love me, love me (just a little bit harder, harder, baby)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder

[Verse 1]
I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell that you were just with her

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you

[Chorus]
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

[Verse 2]
I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say
I know I'm not your only

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you

[Chorus]
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Just a little bit, ooh, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
I know I'm not your only, but at least I'm one
I heard a little love is better than none

[Chorus]
Oh, babe
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit, my baby)
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want (Is all I want)
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Keep your hands on me, don't take them off until I say so
Let me break you off
We'll be taking off or maybe making love
You just keep your eyes on my you know what

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Trembling when you touch
Rush is racing, body begging
Picture me and you making
Making sweet love, baby, give it to me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Eyes on me
Dance on me tonight, you're all, all I need
Keep your hands on me, don’t take them off

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby, put your hands on me

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
It's your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P
It's your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Skirt off, keep the high heels on
I might be a little thing, but I like that long, yeah
Don’t let these eyes fool you
I can take it, hold nothing back, give it to me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Eyes on me
Dance on me tonight, you're all, all I need
Keep your hands on me, don’t take them off

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby, put your hands on me

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
It's your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P
It's your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Can I, can I, can I please put my hand on it?
Shaking like they're burning, lemme put a fan on it
Bumble bee, I can parachute and land on it
'Cause you got the cake, can I put my candle on it?
It's your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P
Got me talking marriage, I like what I see
I'ma put a ring on it, word to Bey and Jay-Z
But before I do that let me put a hand on it
Oh, so hot I could catch a tan on it
Got me sweating so much we can swim on the dance floor
We gon' have to mess around and put a dam on it, dam on it

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
I love the way it feels
Stay back and keep still
Your hands, oh, please
Baby, don't take them off
Don’t take them off

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby, put your hands on me

[Verse 1]
I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

[Chorus]
He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

[Verse 2]
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're travelling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know "sorry" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are

[Chorus]
You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

[Outro]
Ooh, hmm, ha, yeah
You are, you are, you are, ooh
You are, you are, you are
My everything

[Intro: Leon Thomas III]
It's The Rascals!

[Verse 1]
I looked in my rear view mirror
And it seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us
I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that can be the death of us, the death of us

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

[Chorus]
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

[Verse 2]
Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we've found it
Well, that's when we start turning around
You're saying, "Baby, don't worry"
But we're still going the wrong way

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

[Chorus]
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

[Bridge]
They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talking about us
Sometimes I feel like I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gonna be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know that we can find our way home

[Chorus]
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, my baby
Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

[Breakdown]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

[Outro]
I feel like my heart is stuck in… traffic
I'm under… pressure, pressure
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on…
(Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue)
Let's just go back, back, back

[Verse 1]
Baby, I got love for thee so deep inside of me
I don’t know where to start
Yeah, yeah
I love you more than anything
But the words can’t even touch what’s in my heart
No, no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I try to explain it, I be sounding insane
The words don’t ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied and twisted
I can’t explain what I’m feeling
And I say baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah), baby

[Chorus]
(Baby, I) Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I’m tryna say is you’re my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I’m so down for you
No matter what you do (real talk), I’ll be around
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, baby
Baby, I been feeling you before I even knew what feelings were about
Oh, baby

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I try to explain it, I be sounding all crazy
Words don’t ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied and (twisted)
I can’t explain what I’m (feeling)
And I say baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah), baby

[Chorus]
(Baby, I) Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I’m tryna say is you’re my everything, (baby)
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah)
(Baby, baby) Ooh-woah

[Bridge]
Straight up
You got me all in
How could I not be?
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)
If it’s even possible, I love you more than the word “love” can say, yeah
It’s better not explaining
That's why I keep saying

[Chorus]
(Baby, I) Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I’m tryna say is you’re my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah)
Baby (baby, baby), baby, I
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I’m tryna say is you’re my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Every time I try to say it words, they only complicate it
Every time I try to say it words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah)
Baby, baby

If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
Then put your hands up, put your hands up
If you, if you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
Then put your hands up, put your hands up

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe

[Verse 1: Big Sean & Ariana Grande]
Okay, this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, baby

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
And I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy, you’re on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, baby

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Ariana Grande]
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation, would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don’t mind a drive-thru
That’s why I got you
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
I’ll always be right there
I’ll always be right there
You got it, you got it baby
You got it, you got it baby
You got it, you got it baby
You got it, you got it baby, you got it babe

[Verse 1]
You don’t need a lot of money
Honey, you don’t have to play no games
All I need is all your loving
To get the blood rushing through my veins, oh

[Verse 2]
I wanna say we’re going steady
Like it’s 1954
No, it doesn’t have to be forever
Just as long as I’m the name on your tattooed heart

[Chorus]
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart

[Verse 3]
You don’t need to worry about making me crazy
'Cause I’m way past that, yeah
And so just call me if you want me
'Cause you got me
And I’ll show you how much I want to be on your tattooed heart

[Chorus]
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Just as long as I'm the name, on your tattooed heart

[Bridge]
Wrap me in your jacket, my baby
And lay me in your bed
And kiss me underneath the moonlight
Darling, let me trace the lines, on your tattooed heart

[Chorus]
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Just as long as I'm the name, on your tattooed heart

[Intro]
It's The Rascals!
Baby, don’t you know you’ve got all my love, all my love?
Baby, don’t you know you’ve got all my love, all my love?

[Verse 1]
Hold up, wait
Before you go, just stay
And talk to me for a little
Baby, won't you loosen up just a little, eh?

[Pre-Chorus]
See, what you don’t understand
Is falling in love wasn’t part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I’ll ever fall in love, ever fall in love again
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days doing, doing

[Chorus]
Nothing but lovin' you
Nothing but lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my time
I’m lovin' your loving
I’m lovin', I’m lovin' you, baby
Boy you got all my, all my love and affection, all my attention
You don’t gotta question if I’m really loving your lovin'
I’m lovin', I’m lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my, all my

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait
Shut up and kiss me, babe
I just wanna get a little taste
I just wanna get a little taste before you go

[Pre-Chorus]
See, what you don’t understand
Is falling in love wasn’t part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I’ll ever fall in love, ever fall in love again
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days doing, doing

[Chorus]
Nothing but lovin' you
Nothing but lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my time
I’m lovin' your loving
I’m lovin', I’m lovin' you, baby
Boy you got all my, all my love and affection, all my attention
You don’t gotta question if I’m really loving your lovin'
I’m lovin', I’m lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my, all my

[Bridge]
Time and my trust
Don't mess this up
You got me fallin' in love
You got me fallin' in love
You got me fallin' so hard
Boy, you change the way I breathe
When you put your lips on me
I adore you
So let me make it clear to you, that boy, you’re all I need
My baby

[Chorus]
Nothing but lovin' you
Nothing but lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my time
I’m lovin' your loving
I’m lovin', I’m lovin' you, baby
Boy you got all my, all my love and affection, all my attention
You don’t gotta question if I’m really loving your lovin'
I’m lovin', I’m lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my, all my

[Outro]
Baby, don’t you know you’ve got all my love, all my love?
Baby, don’t you know you’ve got all my love, all my love?

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go

[Verse 1]
I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'd find out that my heart was battered
Real hard (Real hard)
It's so hard (It's so hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

[Chorus]
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano

[Verse 2]
I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was battered
Real hard (It's not hard)
So hard (so hard)
Real hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

[Chorus]
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano

[Bridge]
I'd rather tell you about how I'm feeling, boy
And how I'm doing things my way
If I got my piano, then I'm gon' be okay

[Chorus]
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano

[Outro]
I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard

[Verse 1]
You walked in
Caught my attention
I've never seen
A man with so much dimension

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight

[Chorus]
So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you

[Post-Chorus]
Fo—For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Now I can't wait
To hold you in my arms
I know I was made for you
I'm in love with all your charm

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
I don't wanna wait for tonight

[Chorus]
So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you

[Bridge]
Oh, I want ya
Gotta have ya
And I need you
Like I've never had lovin' before
Oh, I want ya
Ou, I need you
Gotta have ya
Like I've never had lovin' before

[Chorus]
So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you
And only you

[Post-Chorus]
Fo—For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh, oh)
For you (Oh, oh)

[Outro: Marjorie Grande & Frank Grande]
He was a man’s man and a ladies man
18, 19, I began to become more serious about things in life
Oh, I think when I was standing on that stoop and I looked at him, yeah, I was 11 years old

[Intro: Ariana Grande (Mac Miller)]
What we gotta do right here is go back
Back into time
I love the way you make me feel (Okay)
I love it, I love it (Yeah)
I love the way you make me feel
I love it (Yeah,) I love it (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Ariana Grande]
Say
I’m thinkin' ’bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower, pickin' petals off of flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not?
I ain’t a player, I just ***** * ***
You give me that kinda somethin'
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten I’m at a 100
Never get enough, I can’t stay away

[Refrain 1: Ariana Grande]
If you want what I got I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave ya
And I ain’t going nowhere 'cause you’re a keeper

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry
Baby, you got me (Ayy)
I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (Hey)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I love the way (You make me feel)
I love the way
I love it, I love it
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ohh, I love the way, the way I love you
I love it, I love it

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Ohh, it's so crazy, you get my heart jumpin'
When you put your lips on mine
And honey it ain’t a question (Qu—qu—question)
'Cause, boy, I know just what you like

[Refrain 2: Ariana Grande]
So if you need it, I got it, I got it every day
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave ya
Said I ain’t going nowhere 'cause you’re a keeper

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry
Baby, you got me (Ayy)
I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (Hey)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I love the way (You make me feel)
I love the way
I love it, I love it
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ohh, I love the way, the way I love you
I love it, I love it

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Uh
I make you feel so fine, make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You a princess to the public, but a freak when it’s time
Said your bed be feelin' lonely, so you sleepin' in mine
Come and watch a movie with me, American Beauty
Or Bruce Almighty, that's groovy, just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for ya I’m not gonna get bored of
But, baby, you an adventure so let me come and explore ya

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry (Yeah)
Baby, you got me (Woo)
I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (Hey) (Uh-huh)

And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I love the way (You make me feel,) I love the way

Ohh, I love the way, the way I love you

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
The way I love you
You, you, yeah, the way
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, the way I love you

[Verse 1]
Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it’s overkill
Don’t get mad at me 'cause you’ve been replaced
Know your place

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it’d be different
If you spoke, I would’ve listened
But now, I’m with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but...

[Chorus]
You will never know what we could have been
If you would’ve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (yup, yup)
'Cause you didn’t know, so
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know

[Verse 2]
Now it’s probably hard for you to hear
But there’s nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands, boy, but you don’t understand
Is a girl like me don’t have no time to waste around

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it’d be different
If you spoke, I would’ve listened
But now, I’m with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but...

[Chorus]
You will never know what we could have been
If you would’ve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (yup, yup)
'Cause you didn’t know, so
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know
You’ll never know
Boy, you should’ve told me, told me
You’ll never know
Boy, you should’ve let me know
You’ll never know
Boy, you could’ve been there for me
But now you’ll never know, you’ll never know

[Bridge]
It’s not my fault
You’re a little bit too late
You’re the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times
But none of that will change my mind, boy
You had a chance you’ll never get back, get back

[Chorus]
You will never know what we could have been
If you would’ve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (yup, yup)
'Cause you didn’t know, so
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know
You’ll never know
Boy, you should’ve told me, told me
You’ll never know
Boy, you should’ve let me know
You’ll never know
Boy, you could’ve been there for me
But now you’ll never know, you’ll never know

[Outro]
Boy, you’ll never know, you’ll never know
You’ll never know, you’ll never know

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

[Verse 2: Nathan Sykes]
If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Nathan Sykes]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

[Bridge: Ariana Grande & Nathan Sykes]
Huh-huh, baby
You know, you know, baby
Almost, is never enough, baby
You know, hey
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Nathan Sykes]
Almost, almost is never enough (Is never enough, baby)
So close to being in love (So close)
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was (Baby)
But almost is never enough

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
Huh-huh, baby (Almost)
You know, you know, baby
Almost, is never enough, baby
You know, hey

[Verse 1: Both]
You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish
Standing on the field with your pretty pompoms
Now you're working at the movies selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
Cause I’m puttin' down my story in a popular song
Ahh, I said I'm putting down my story in a popular song

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, cause my song is popular

[Chorus: MIKA]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That’s all you ever need to know

[Post-Chorus: Both]
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go

[Verse 2: Both]
Always on the lookout for someone to hate
Pickin' on me like a dinner plate
You hid during classes and in between 'em
Dunk me in the toilets now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughing, got everyone clapping, askin'
How come you look so cool?
Cause that’s the only thing that I learned at school, boy
Uh huh, I said that’s the only thing that I learned at school

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, cause my song is popular

[Chorus: MIKA]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That’s all you ever need to know

[Post-Chorus: Both]
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
That’s all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
That’s all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
That’s all you ever need to know

[Chorus: Both]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That’s all you ever need to know

[Verse 1]
I told you once, "Get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be alright"
But some things are better left unsaid
To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna say things like "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe

[Verse 2]
I could tell a lie
Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna say things like "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe

[Bridge]
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up

[Outro]
I could tell a lie
Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid
